# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide is designed to help bootcamp students review the course materials. My motivation to learn how to code is to increase my skillset of this in-demand job and challenge myself with something new.

I built this project to teach me the foundations of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.

This project solves the problem of taking the lessons from the prework and applying it to a real web developer workflow to give me context and an introduction to the course.

I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript and how all of them work together to build and deploy a final web page. I also learned that web development is an ongoing learning experience and that having an open mind is key.
