# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide is designed to help bootcamp students review the course materials. My motivation to learn how to code is to increase my skillset of this in-demand job and challenge myself with something new.

I built this project to teach me the foundations of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.

This project solves the problem of taking the lessons from the prework and applying it to a real web developer workflow to give me context and an introduction to the course.

I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript and how all of them work together to build and deploy a final web page. I also learned that web development is an ongoing learning experience and that having an open mind is key.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
